Fantasy Football Bots

ESPNTele: Telegram bot for ESPN Fantasy Football
- v1 (Free Agent Pickup Feed) 

## what it does
- this bot will push notifications to a telegram channel when a team in your league either picks up or drops a player.
- it does this by first getting the current state of the league, then diffing the players on subsequent checks.
- this means that the initial state of the teams is when this is first run.
  - if you opt into persisting your data, you can pick up where you were last time. by mounting the storage directory as described below
